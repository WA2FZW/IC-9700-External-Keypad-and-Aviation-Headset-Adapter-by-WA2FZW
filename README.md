This simple printed circuit board implements the "External Keypad" described
on page 13-3 of the IC-9700 Basic Manual (it also works on the IC-705) and
a circuit to allow one to use an aviation type headset with the radio. I use
a David Clark H10-13.4.

Use of the headset allows hands-free operation (VOX enabled) which makes
note taking and logging much easier than when wrestling with the hand mic.

The keypad allows you to send canned messages 1 through 4 at the push of a
button. To do it on the radio itself you have to bring the appropriate
keypad up on the touch screen which precludes using the spectrum display.

When I get a chance I'll write up a bit of proper documentation and include
a BOM
